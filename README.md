# A-Frame Scenes

Repo for creating WebVR scenes using A-Frame, Three, and AR.js. If you don't know about these libraries, they're javascript based and they're awesome! I created most of the objects in my scenes with __[TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com)__ which is a free browser-based 3D modeling tool. 

Moving forward I'd like to:

    - enhance mobile performance of my space shooter game
    - create multi-scene experiences without page redirects... maybe with React?
    - do more things with AR.js
    - animated experience with user-camera fixed along path

## Getting Started with A-Frame

> :iphone: **Mobile pro tip:** Upon starting the development server, the URL will be logged to the console. Load that URL from a browser on your mobile device. (If your mobile phone and computer are not on the same LAN, consider using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for local development and testing. [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) is also worth a gander.)
